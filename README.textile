h1. LovelyLayouts

Here's a bunch of helpers I find myself needing every time I start up a new Rails project.  Mostly, it's just some nicer DSL wrappers around the @content_for@ patterns we all use to get get content up from the view to the layout in a Rails application (for titles, etc).

h2. In your view

 <!-- app/views/posts/show.html.erb -->
 <% title @post.title %>
 <% description @post.description %>
 <% keywords @post.tags.join(", ") %>
 <% copyright @post.user.full_name %>
 
h2. In your layout

  <html>
    <head>
      <%= title_tag "optional default title here" %>
      <%= description_tag "optional default meta description here" %>
      <%= keywords_tag "optional default meta keywords here" %>
      <%= copyright_tag "optional default meta copyright notice here" %>
    </head>
    <body>
      ...
      <%= yield %>
      ...
    </body>
  </html>
  
h2. And a neat trick for the @<body>@ tag

A block helper for creating body tags is also in there.  The @id@ is generated from @params[:controller]@ (eg "posts"), and the @class@ is generated from @params[:controller]@ name and @params[:action]@ (eg "posts show").

  <% body do %>
    ...
  <% end %>
  
Which pushes out something like this:

  <body id="posts" class="posts show">
    ...
  </body>
  
You can set the @id@ and @class@ from your views:

  <% body_id "blog" %>
  <% body_class "whatever" %>

You can override the @id@ and @class@ (or any attribute of the @<body>@ tag) too:
  
  <% body :id => "blog", :class => "whatever", :onload => "party()" do %>
    ...
  <% end %>


h2. There's always a TODO List

* might write some tests!
* really should offer the usual prefix/suffix stuff that I tend to need in @<title>@ tag
* probably try to distill the way I do tabs too
  
  
h2. Blah blah blah blah
